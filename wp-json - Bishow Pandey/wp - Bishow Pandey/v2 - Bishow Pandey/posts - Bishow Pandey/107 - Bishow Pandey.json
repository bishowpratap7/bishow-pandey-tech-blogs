This is powered by Red Hat. It provides developers and IT organizations with an auto-scaling, cloud application platform for deploying new applications on secure, scalable resources with nominal configuration and management overhead.<br>OpenShift is easy to use, develop, and deploy applications on cloud because of these features:<br>It can run on Windows, LInux and other platform easily and hence not dependent on underlying operating system.<br>It also has a present of OpenShift community which helps developers and testers quickly build, deploy, and scale containerized applications on the public cloud.<br>Automatic Application Scaling aka Pod Scaling in OpenShift Language.<br>Responsive Web Console and rich command-line tools.<br>Provide support for remote SSH login to application.<br>Rest API Support as RESTful APIs are easily accessible via HTTP(s) on the OpenShift Container Platform targeting authority or master servers.<br>Provides support for continuous integration and release management via Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines channel.<br>Extensible Cartridge System meaning a cartridge provides the required libraries, source code, connection logic, routing logic etc. to run the components of your applications.<br>Cartridge system is important but has some disadvantage so from a packaging perspective, an image theory was rather chosen, as this performs more tasks than a cartridge, and provides better encapsulation and flexibility<br>Once the setup and deployment process is ready next developers or testers job is as easy as one-click Deployment, which is turn saves a whole lot of time and money for a company.<br>Multi Environment Support as this can run parallely in Dev, Test and Production environment with different versions running independently of each other.<br>At the time of writing I have seen that remote debugging of Java Applications is easily possible using VisualVM to the forwarded ports and attaching Java Debugger. I sure believe that other programming language such as Python, .Net also has these feature ready to go.<br>Built-in Database Services for multiple database and language support.<br>IDE Integration such as JetBrains IntelliJ Red Hat OpenShift extension provides debug support for OpenShift components.<br>Standardized Developers and Testers workflow, as they can stop worrying about infrastructure which gives them freedom to write and test the code in their own efficient way.<br>Self-service on Demand Application Stack meaning you can chose languages and tools you want along with pre-created container images and templates that allow you to build and deploy your favorite application.<br>It also has private cluster offering which is available on the Amazon Web Services (AWS: You can now acquire Red Hat OpenShift licensing through AWS, and then quickly deploy managed OpenShift clusters in your account.) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP : Helps with service account creation that provides authentication and authorization to access data in the Google APIs) bazaars.<br>Some of the OpenShift specific terms:<br>Routes:<br>It is a way to externalize the services by providing externally reachable hostname. In OpenShift routes are created using routers developed by admin.<br>Source-to-image Strategy:<br>In Source-to-image strategy source code is downloaded and compiled and deployed in same container.<br>Pod:<br>It is a collection of containers and its storage inside a node of a Kubernetes cluster. It is possible to create a pod with multiple containers inside it.<br>Stateful Pods:<br>Enables pods to be stopped and restarted while retaining the same network address and storage attached to them.<br>Deployment Strategies:<br>A deployment strategy is a way to change or upgrade an application.<br>Rolling Strategy:<br>A rolling deployment typically waits for new pods to become ready via a readiness check before scaling down the old components.<br>This is meant for absolute beginners.For more information please follow the Red Hat Documentation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OpenShift is a cloud development Platform as a Service (PaaS) which was assembled around a core of docker container packaging and Kubernetes container along with cluster management.
