At least 9 GB RAM<br>b. At least 40 GB disk space for the virtual disk<br>c. At least 4 vCPUs (How to check this ) The easiest way for Windows user to find would be Open Task Manager and under Performance Tab click on CPU. Then on the bottom right you will see this<br>d. Install or activate Hyper-V on Windows 10 so that you can create virtual machines as needed.<br>How do I do this Open a PowerShell console as Administrator.Run the following command Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All<br>Step 2 Download<br>Don\u2019t just google \u201cdownload openshift\u203f as this leads you all over the place. Let\u2019s keep in mind that the process and terms used here are different.<br>Before you download lets understand a Term called<br>CRC aka CodeReady Containers This helps you up and running with an OpenShift cluster (Group of servers or nodes) on your local machine.<br>Now search this in your search engine \u201cdownload codeready containers\u201c. This should lead you to this page httpsdevelopers.redhat.comproductscodeready-containersoverview<br>Then click on \u201cInstall OpenShift On you Laptop \u201c. Which will have you (Red Hat) sign up. Once that is done you should be at least on this page.<br>Once here, click on \u201cDownload Code-Ready Containers\u203f. Don\u2019t forget to download or Copy Pull Secret which you will need.<br>For this demo I have downloaded and unzipped on this folder \u201cDLocal Openshift \u2013 CRC\u203f<br>Congratulations you are making progress.<br>Step 3 Install and Setup<br>a. Go to that folder location and open up the unzipped folder. Open Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell and run this command crc setup or .crc setup for Powershell<br>You will feel like nothing is happening but it is checking the prerequisites and confuringing drivers and network so stay tight. Have some patience.<br>Oh Snap !!!! Not really, just restart and re-run crc setup again and should be good to move further. (Above).<br>b. Don\u2019t just run crc start yet just because it said so (Above) . As this will ask for pull secret and just confuses the setup process (Below) . But if you want to run both at same time that is fine as well crc.exe start -p pull-secret.txt<br>Instead first config the crc.<br>crc config set pull-secret-file \u201cyour file path\u203f<br>Now run crc start (Below)<br>Once done run this command as shown crc oc-env<br>And you should see the suggested command (Below) to set the path run that SET PATH command as shown<br>c. Verifying This should be the last step to verify that OpenShift has successfully been installed locally.<br>Run crc version as above and you should see the version.<br>Open your Hyper-V Manager and check if that says running as well.<br>Now let\u2019s run this final command to start the OpenShift Console via crc command<br>This is how your openshift console should look like.<br>Congratulations, now you have installed OpenShift on your computer.<br>Keep in mind that creating, updating projects etc will be done using oc (OpenShift CLI) command tool which was installed during this process.<br>There are a whole lot of features provided by oc (OpenShift CLI) like below<br>This should be an absolute begineer setup.
