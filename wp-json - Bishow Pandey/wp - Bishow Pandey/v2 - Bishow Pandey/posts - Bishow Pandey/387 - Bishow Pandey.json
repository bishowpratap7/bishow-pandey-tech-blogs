Here are 100 differences between serialization and deserialization:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Serialization is the process of converting data or objects into a byte stream, while deserialization is the process of converting a byte stream back into data or objects.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization is used for data persistence, network communication, and object sharing, while deserialization is used for data retrieval and object reconstruction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization transforms data or objects into a portable format that can be transmitted or stored, while deserialization restores the data or objects to their original form.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization is often used to save data to disk or send it over a network, while deserialization is used to load data from disk or receive it over a network.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization typically involves writing data to an output stream, while deserialization involves reading data from an input stream.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can handle complex data structures, object graphs, and recursive references, while deserialization reconstructs these structures and references during the process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can include metadata about the serialized data or objects, such as class information and field names, while deserialization can interpret and utilize this metadata during the reconstruction.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can be used to transfer objects between different programming languages or platforms, while deserialization allows these objects to

JSON serialization, or custom serialization formats.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can be customized by providing custom serialization filters or converters, allowing specific transformations or manipulations of the serialized data during serialization and deserialization.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can handle exceptions during the serialization process, such as <code>NotSerializableException<\/code> when attempting to serialize an object that does not implement the <code>Serializable<\/code> interface, while deserialization can handle exceptions during the reconstruction process, such as <code>ClassNotFoundException<\/code> when the class definition is not found.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can be used for distributed computing, where serialized objects are sent across network boundaries to remote systems for processing or computation, while deserialization reconstructs the objects on the remote systems.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can be

subsequent sessions through deserialization.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can handle large data sets or objects, where the serialized byte stream can be split into smaller chunks for more efficient storage, transmission, or processing, while deserialization reconstructs the data or objects from these chunks.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Serialization can be used for deep object traversal, where all
