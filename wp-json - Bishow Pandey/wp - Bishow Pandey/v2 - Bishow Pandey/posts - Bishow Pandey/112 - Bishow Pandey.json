It provides a simple yet powerful API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network connections. OkHttpClient is commonly used in Java applications, including Android apps, for performing HTTP communication with servers or APIs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key features and functionalities of OkHttpClient:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>HTTP Request\/Response Handling: OkHttpClient supports making various types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. It allows customization of request headers, parameters, timeouts, and caching mechanisms.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Connection Pooling: OkHttpClient manages a connection pool to reuse and efficiently manage TCP connections to the server. This helps reduce latency and improve performance by minimizing the overhead of establishing new connections for subsequent requests.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automatic Retry and Redirects: OkHttpClient provides built-in support for handling automatic retries on failed requests and following redirects. It allows configuring the maximum number of retries, backoff strategies, and redirect policies.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Interceptors: Interceptors in OkHttpClient allow developers to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses. This feature enables adding custom logic, such as adding headers, logging, or applying authentication mechanisms, to the request\/response pipeline.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Asynchronous Requests: OkHttpClient offers asynchronous request execution, allowing multiple requests to be executed concurrently and asynchronously without blocking the main thread. This is particularly useful in scenarios where responsiveness and parallelism are crucial, such as in mobile or web applications.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>WebSocket Support: OkHttpClient provides WebSocket implementation, enabling bidirectional communication between the client and the server using the WebSocket protocol. This allows real-time data exchange and event-driven communication over a single, long-lived connection.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Connection Timeouts and Connection Pool Eviction: OkHttpClient allows setting connection timeouts to avoid waiting indefinitely for a response. It also provides options to evict connections from the connection pool based on specified conditions, such as maximum idle time or maximum number of requests.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code lang=\"java\" class=\"language-java\">class YourService\n{\n    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(YourService.class);\n    private final OkHttpClient  okHttpClient;\n    private final ObjectWriter  objectWriter;\n    private final String        baseUrl;\n    YourService(OkHttpClient okHttpClient, ObjectMapper objectMapper,\n        YourHttpRequestProperties yourHttpRequestProperties)\n    {\n        Assert.notNull(okHttpClient, \"OkHttpClient must not be null\");\n        this.okHttpClient = okHttpClient;\n        this.objectWriter = objectMapper.writer();\n      \/\/For Http Properties you can use :  \n      \/\/ @ConfigurationProperties(\"http\") @Validated on your class\n      \/\/and wire it through properties file such as yml\n        Assert.hasText(yourHttpRequestProperties.getBaseUrl(), \"BaseUrl must not be blank\");\n        this.baseUrl = yourHttpRequestProperties.getBaseUrl();\n    }\n    void update(YourRequest yourRequest)\n    {\n        log.debug(\"Processing request: {}\", yourRequest);\n        try\n        {\n            String json = objectWriter.writeValueAsString(yourRequest);\n            String url = baseUrl\n                + \"\/v1\/some-request\";\n            Request request = new Request.Builder().url(url)\n                .post(RequestBody.create(\n                    MediaType.parse(org.springframework.http.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE),\n                    json))\n                .build();\n            try (Response response = okHttpClient.newCall(yourRequest).execute())\n            {\n                if (response.isSuccessful())\n                {\n              \/\/Do your thing\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    \/\/Something\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        catch (IOException e)\n        {\n        \/\/Do your thing\n        }\n    }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, OkHttpClient is a robust and feature-rich HTTP client library for Java, offering flexibility, performance optimizations, and a comprehensive set of functionalities for making HTTP requests and handling responses in Java applications.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OkHttpClient is a widely used open-source HTTP client library for Java, developed by Square Inc.
