and will continue processing it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>101 Switching Protocols The server agrees to switch protocols specified in the Upgrade header of the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>102 Processing The server is still processing the request, and the client should wait for the final response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>103 Early Hints The server is sending some headers to the client before sending the final response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>200 OK The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>201 Created The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource is created as a result.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>202 Accepted The request has been accepted but not yet acted upon.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>203 Non-Authoritative Information The server successfully processed the request, but the returned information may be from another source.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>204 No Content The server successfully processed the request, but there is no representation to return.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>205 Reset Content The server asks the client to reset the document from which the original request was sent.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>206 Partial Content The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>207 Multi-Status The message body that follows is an XML message containing multiple status codes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>208 Already Reported The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>226 IM Used The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>300 Multiple Choices The requested resource has multiple choices, each with different locations.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>301 Moved Permanently The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>302 Found (Previously &#8220;Moved Temporarily&#8221;) The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>303 See Other The response to the request can be found under a different URI.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>304 Not Modified The client can use the cached copy of the requested resource since it has not been modified.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>305 Use Proxy The requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>306 (Unused) This status code was used in a previous version of the HTTP\/1.1 specification but is no longer used.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>307 Temporary Redirect The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI, and the client should use the provided URI for future requests.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>308 Permanent Redirect The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URI, and any future references should use this URI.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>400 Bad Request The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>401 Unauthorized The request requires user authentication.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>402 Payment Required This status code is reserved for future use.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>403 Forbidden The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>404 Not Found The requested resource could not be found on the server.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>405 Method Not Allowed The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>406 Not Acceptable The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>407 Proxy Authentication Required The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>408 Request Timeout The client did not produce a request within the time the server was prepared to wait.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>409 Conflict The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>410 Gone The requested resource is no longer available, and no forwarding address is known.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>411 Length Required The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length header.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>412 Precondition Failed One or more conditions in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>413 Payload Too Large The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>414 URI Too Long The URI provided in the request is too long for the server to process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>415 Unsupported Media Type The server does not support the media type requested in the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>416 Range Not Satisfiable The requested range cannot be served as it is outside the bounds of the available data.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>417 Expectation Failed The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>418 I&#8217;m a teapot This code was defined in 1998 as an April Fool&#8217;s joke and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>421 Misdirected Request The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>422 Unprocessable Entity The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>423 Locked The resource that is being accessed is locked.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>424 Failed Dependency The request failed due to the failure of a previous request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>426 Upgrade Required The client should switch to a different protocol, specified in the Upgrade header field.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>428 Precondition Required The server requires the request to be conditional.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>429 Too Many Requests The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>431 Request Header Fields Too Large The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field or all the header fields collectively are too large.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>501 Not Implemented The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>502 Bad Gateway The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>503 Service Unavailable The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance of the server.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>504 Gateway Timeout The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI or some other auxiliary server it needed to access to complete the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>505 HTTP Version Not Supported The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>506 Variant Also Negotiates The server has an internal configuration error and the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself and is therefore not a proper endpoint in the negotiation process.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>507 Insufficient Storage The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>508 Loop Detected The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>510 Not Extended Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>511 Network Authentication Required The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This list covers the top 62 HTTP status codes.
