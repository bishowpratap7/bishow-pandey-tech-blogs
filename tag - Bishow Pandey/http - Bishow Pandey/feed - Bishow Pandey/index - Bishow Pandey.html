<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) defines a wide range of status codes to communicate the status of requests made by clients to web servers. Here is a list of the top 200 HTTP status codes with their detailed descriptions:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>100 Continue The server has received the initial part of the request and will continue processing it.</li>



<li>101 Switching Protocols The server agrees to switch protocols specified in the Upgrade header of the request.</li>



<li>102 Processing The server is still processing the request, and the client should wait for the final response.</li>



<li>103 Early Hints The server is sending some headers to the client before sending the final response.</li>



<li>200 OK The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.</li>



<li>201 Created The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource is created as a result.</li>



<li>202 Accepted The request has been accepted but not yet acted upon.</li>



<li>203 Non-Authoritative Information The server successfully processed the request, but the returned information may be from another source.</li>



<li>204 No Content The server successfully processed the request, but there is no representation to return.</li>



<li>205 Reset Content The server asks the client to reset the document from which the original request was sent.</li>



<li>206 Partial Content The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.</li>



<li>207 Multi-Status The message body that follows is an XML message containing multiple status codes.</li>



<li>208 Already Reported The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply.</li>



<li>226 IM Used The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.</li>



<li>300 Multiple Choices The requested resource has multiple choices, each with different locations.</li>



<li>301 Moved Permanently The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource should use one of the returned URIs.</li>



<li>302 Found (Previously &#8220;Moved Temporarily&#8221;) The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI.</li>



<li>303 See Other The response to the request can be found under a different URI.</li>



<li>304 Not Modified The client can use the cached copy of the requested resource since it has not been modified.</li>



<li>305 Use Proxy The requested resource must be accessed through the proxy given by the Location field.</li>



<li>306 (Unused) This status code was used in a previous version of the HTTP/1.1 specification but is no longer used.</li>



<li>307 Temporary Redirect The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URI, and the client should use the provided URI for future requests.</li>



<li>308 Permanent Redirect The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URI, and any future references should use this URI.</li>



<li>400 Bad Request The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax.</li>



<li>401 Unauthorized The request requires user authentication.</li>



<li>402 Payment Required This status code is reserved for future use.</li>



<li>403 Forbidden The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.</li>



<li>404 Not Found The requested resource could not be found on the server.</li>



<li>405 Method Not Allowed The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource.</li>



<li>406 Not Acceptable The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.</li>



<li>407 Proxy Authentication Required The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.</li>



<li>408 Request Timeout The client did not produce a request within the time the server was prepared to wait.</li>



<li>409 Conflict The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource.</li>



<li>410 Gone The requested resource is no longer available, and no forwarding address is known.</li>



<li>411 Length Required The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-Length header.</li>



<li>412 Precondition Failed One or more conditions in the request header fields evaluated to false when tested on the server.</li>



<li>413 Payload Too Large The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.</li>



<li>414 URI Too Long The URI provided in the request is too long for the server to process.</li>



<li>415 Unsupported Media Type The server does not support the media type requested in the request.</li>



<li>416 Range Not Satisfiable The requested range cannot be served as it is outside the bounds of the available data.</li>



<li>417 Expectation Failed The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.</li>



<li>418 I&#8217;m a teapot This code was defined in 1998 as an April Fool&#8217;s joke and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers.</li>



<li>421 Misdirected Request The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.</li>



<li>422 Unprocessable Entity The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.</li>



<li>423 Locked The resource that is being accessed is locked.</li>



<li>424 Failed Dependency The request failed due to the failure of a previous request.</li>



<li>426 Upgrade Required The client should switch to a different protocol, specified in the Upgrade header field.</li>



<li>428 Precondition Required The server requires the request to be conditional.</li>



<li>429 Too Many Requests The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.</li>



<li>431 Request Header Fields Too Large The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field or all the header fields collectively are too large.</li>



<li>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.</li>



<li>500 Internal Server Error The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.</li>



<li>501 Not Implemented The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.</li>



<li>502 Bad Gateway The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.</li>



<li>503 Service Unavailable The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or maintenance of the server.</li>



<li>504 Gateway Timeout The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server specified by the URI or some other auxiliary server it needed to access to complete the request.</li>



<li>505 HTTP Version Not Supported The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.</li>



<li>506 Variant Also Negotiates The server has an internal configuration error and the chosen variant resource is configured to engage in transparent content negotiation itself and is therefore not a proper endpoint in the negotiation process.</li>



<li>507 Insufficient Storage The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed to successfully complete the request.</li>



<li>508 Loop Detected The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.</li>



<li>510 Not Extended Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it.</li>



<li>511 Network Authentication Required The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.</li>
</ol>



<p>This list covers the top 62 HTTP status codes. Note that there are more status codes in the HTTP specification, but they are less commonly encountered in everyday web development scenarios.</p>
